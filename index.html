<p>
The MaratonIME ICPC Spring School 2018 is organized by
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~maratona" target="_blank">MaratonIME</a>
and hosted by
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/" target="_blank">IME-USP</a>
during one week from
<strong>October 8th</strong> to <strong>October 12th</strong>.
Our main goal is to train
<a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/" target="_blank">ICPC</a>
contestants from all over the world for the national
regionals and the World Finals.
<p>

<p>
The instructor is from Slovakia, so all the activities will be held in <strong>English</strong>.
</p>

<p>
All interested students must register individually through the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/registration">registration page</a>.
If you have a team, all three members must register individually. There is no fee, but we will
<strong>not</strong> provide any kind of food, housing or transportation.
</p>

<p>
We are studying the possibility of live streaming the classes.
